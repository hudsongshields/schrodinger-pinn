# PINN for Solving Schrödinger Equation

### Overview
This project demonstrates the application of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve the Schrödinger equation, a fundamental equation in quantum mechanics. PINNs leverage neural networks that incorporate physical laws (represented as differential equations) as part of the loss function during training. This approach allows for the integration of both data-driven and physics-based knowledge into the model.
